            <h2> 1 How will you improve the performance of a React Application? </h2>
            <p> <span> Answer: </span> <br />
                Optimize is very important So try Maximum Optimize React-rendering, and also try to avoid over-rendering unnecessary features. need to make confirm that react components receive only necessary props.. .Avoid inline functions as much as possible.  Immutability is the key to avoid unnecessary re-renders. Always render hidden components like a modal and Dropdown conditionally. Always call multiple APIs parallelly.
